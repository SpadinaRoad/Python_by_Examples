# Python_by_Examples

Nichola Lacey wrote the book Python by Example: Learning to Program in 150 Challenges.

The challenges ask you to write Python code to achieve a certain objective.

I have written written code for each example or challenge.

I include __doc__ strings to quote the challenge from the book.

In writing my code I include some error-trapping code that isn't required by the example.

I also create while loops to continue the code until 'x' is entered. This allows for multiple input attempts and testing the branching with if statements.
