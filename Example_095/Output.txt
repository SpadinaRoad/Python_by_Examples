Create an array of five numbers
between 10 and 100 which each have
two decimal places. Ask the user to
enter a whole number between 2 and 5.
If they enter something outside of that
range, display a suitable error message
and ask them to try again until they
enter a valid amount. Divide each of the
numbers in the array by the number the
user entered and display the answers
shown to two decimal places.


Here is a list of random two-decimal numbers: 
68.56

The numbers divided by 3:
