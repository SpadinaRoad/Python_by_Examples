In Python, it is not technically possible to directly
delete a record from a .csv file. Instead you need
to save the file to a temporary list in Python,
make the changes to the list and then overwrite
the original file with the temporary list.
Change the previous program to allow you to do
this. Your menu should now look like this:

Create the following menu:
    A. Add to file
    B. View all records
    C. Delete a record
    X. Quit program
    Enter your selection :
