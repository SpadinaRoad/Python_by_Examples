Ask the user to enter a number between
10 and 20. If they enter a value under 10,
display the message “Too low” and ask
them to try again. If they enter a value
above 20, display the message “Too high”
and ask them to try again. Keep repeating
this until they enter a value that is
between 10 and 20 and then display the
message “Thank you”.
